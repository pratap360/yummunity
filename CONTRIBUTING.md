## üìÖ Environment files Changes
Kindly replace all the id's from your accont written in **CAPITALS LETTERS** over here and make sure don't change any keyword names.

If you have any doubt you can check out the offical documentation from the Appwrite [ Documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs)

```env
# Appwrite Setup  [DEV setup]
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  appwrite_Endpoint: 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1',
  appwrite_ProjectID: 'YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
  appwrite_DatabaseID: 'YOUR-DATABASE-ID',

  users_CollectionID: 'YOUR-COLLECTION-ID',
  post_CollectionID: 'YOUR-POST-COLLECTION-ID',
  blogpost_CollectionID: 'YOUR-BLOGPOST-COLLECTION-ID',

  PostImages_BucketID: 'YOUR-POSTIMAGES-BUCKET-ID',
  Profile_pictures_BucketID: 'YOUR-PROFILE-PICTURES-BUCKET-ID',
  Blog_thumbnail_BucketID: 'YOUR-BLOG-THUMBNAIL-BUCKET-ID',

    # not mandatory
  Unsplash_AccessKey: 'YOUR-UNSPLASH_ACCESSKEY',
};

```
Similarly you have create another file for production environoments 

```env
# Appwrite Setup  [PROD setup]
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  appwrite_Endpoint: 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1',
  appwrite_ProjectID: 'YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
  appwrite_DatabaseID: 'YOUR-DATABASE-ID',

  users_CollectionID: 'YOUR-COLLECTION-ID',
  post_CollectionID: 'YOUR-POST-COLLECTION-ID',
  blogpost_CollectionID: 'YOUR-BLOGPOST-COLLECTION-ID',

  PostImages_BucketID: 'YOUR-POSTIMAGES-BUCKET-ID',
  Profile_pictures_BucketID: 'YOUR-PROFILE-PICTURES-BUCKET-ID',
  Blog_thumbnail_BucketID: 'YOUR-BLOG-THUMBNAIL-BUCKET-ID',

    # not mandatory
  Unsplash_AccessKey: 'YOUR-UNSPLASH_ACCESSKEY',
};

```

## üîó Connect Appwrite to Yummunity (Code Tip)

Install Appwrite SDK:
```bash
npm install appwrite
```

Example setup in a utility file (`lib/appwrite.js`):
```js
import { Client, Databases, Storage } from 'appwrite';

const client = new Client()
  .setEndpoint(process.env.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
  .setProject(process.env.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID);

const databases = new Databases(client);
const storage = new Storage(client);

export { client, databases, storage };
```

Then you can use it like this:
```js
// Create a recipe document
await databases.createDocument(
  process.env.APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID,
  process.env.APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID,
  'unique()',
  {
    title: 'Delicious Pasta',
    description: 'Step-by-step recipe...',
    imageUrl: 'https://...',
    userId: 'current_user_id'
  }
);
```
